# Contributing

We'd love to have pull requests or bug reports :-) In case we do not react timely,
do not hesitate to get in touch with us e.g. via [kontakt@sandstorm.de](mailto:kontakt@sandstorm.de),
as it might happen that a pull request slips through.

## Developing

Simply have a modern Go version installed; check out the project somewhere (NOT in $GOPATH, as we use Go Modules),
and then run `./build.sh`.

## Releasing new versions

### Prerequisites for releasing

1. ensure you have [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) installed:

  ```bash
  brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser
  ```

2. Create a new token for goreleaser [in your GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens); select the `repo` scope.

3. put the just-created token into the file `~/.config/goreleaser/github_token`


### Doing the release

Testing a release:

```
goreleaser --snapshot --skip-publish --rm-dist --debug
```

Executing a release:

1. Commit all changes, create a new tag and push it.

```
TAG=v0.9.0 git tag $TAG; git push origin $TAG
```

2. run goreleaser:

```
goreleaser --rm-dist
```

### Docsify

docsify serve ./docs
